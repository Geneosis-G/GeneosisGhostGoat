[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]This mod is probably the one that tooks me the longer to release after I started it, but it's finally here!
It combines two main ideas I had when I started modding on Goat Sim: The first one is the possibility to control NPCs (I wanted to include that in the Target Goat mod). The second is the possibility to fly.
I started this mod by creating the ghost mode, which means creating a new body that is transparent, can fly and can pass through objects. Ironically the thing in this list I spent a lot of time on is the transparency X) The main problem was that you can't just add alpha using code, or more precisely you can, but if the texture of the goat don't have the correct parameters it have no effect at all -_- Hopefully the 1.1 update saved me by adding a transparent texture on every goat (used when the camera is too closed to the goat).
When the ghost was done, I started thinking about a better way to control NPCs. The first method I thought about was to convert the GGNpc object into a GGGoat object and then control it with the default player controller: This method was way too hard to implement and that's why abandoned the idea during the Target Goat conception.
The second method was to turn the goat invisible and to attach it to the NPC. This was working nicely, except for moving the NPC: The AI of the NPC was completely broking the player commands and the NPC was acting not at all as expected.
Finally the last method I imagined, and the one in the current version, just attach the player controller to the GGNpc object. This is only possible since 1.1, the only remaining problem with this method is that the camera is a bit crappy: As the controlled object is not a GGGoat, the camera mode is set to default and you lost all the effects of the goat camera (zoom, smooth moves, bounces when sprinting, etc...).
So with this last method, the mouvements are working correctly, I just had to manually configure the ragdoll key and the animations to play on the NPC.
